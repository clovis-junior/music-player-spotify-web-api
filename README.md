# Spotify API (beta) for [Music Player Overlay](https://github.com/clovis-junior/music-player-overlay)
Hi, thats a project made only by myself using NodeJS with Express.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a API for my other project called [Music Player Overlay](https://github.com/clovis-junior/music-player-overlay). For now, this is a beta version.

### A hard work has comming...
- [ ] Create a **custom WebSocket** and **destroy the error 429** from **official Spotify API** request
- [ ] Turn this more practical for other developers using your own Spotify App.
- [ ] Use the Playback SDK from **official Spotify API**
